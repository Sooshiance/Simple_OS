# Nobu

Years ago, my system was infected with these kind of viruses. As a developer, it costs me lot of times and effort to handle such
situation. Now, As a skilled developer, I decided to create its defense system.

# Caution

Be careful about using the `attack` version of this program. It can hide itself from your `task manager` or `system monitor`.
If you wanna test it(Don't do that, Don't):
- Install a virtualbox
- Install a machine(Windows nt, Unix POSIX)
- Install Rust on that machine
- Test it
- Never do that in your main machine
